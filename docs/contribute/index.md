### Mission

- Enhance Liberal Arts in ICU by making academic planning easy

### Vision

- All the ICU students can deepen their academic career by comparing all the courses and planning the registration ahead.
- All the ICU students can actively participate in their academic process by visualising the academic path.

### Value

- **Open**: open-source, open-community
  - anyone can submit feature request, content modification request easily (via GitHub?)
  - Show reference of syllabus, requirements, and the rules of taking course (so that students can check the original data by themselves)
  - Show updated date
- **Serendipity**: Ensuring the chance that students can come across other academic fields in the vast ocean of Liberal Arts.
